# Spectra Health — HMIS

A complete, production-ready **Multi-facility Hospital Management Information System (HMIS/HIMS)** for Spectra Health.

Built with **Next.js 16**, **TypeScript**, **Prisma ORM**, **NextAuth.js**, **shadcn/ui**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

> **Production stack**: Deployed on **Vercel** with **Neon PostgreSQL**. See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for the full deployment guide.

> **Core Principle**: ONE PATIENT = ONE MASTER PATIENT RECORD. Patients are organization-level (NOT facility-owned); encounters are facility-specific. A patient registered at Facility A can visit Facility B without creating a duplicate record — their entire longitudinal medical history is preserved across all Spectra Health facilities.

## 📦 Seeded Data

The seed script (`scripts/seed.ts`) creates:

- **1 Organization**: Spectra Health
- **3 Facilities**: Accra, Kasoa, Tema (each with 16 departments, 6 wards, 6 rooms × 6 beds)
- **13 Default Users** (one per role, see above)
- **92 Permissions** across 16 modules
- **13 Default Roles** with permission assignments
- **3 Insurance Providers**: NHIS, Acacia, Metropolitan
- **15 Lab Tests** (CBC, FBG, LFT, KFT, HIV, etc.)
- **18 Services** with facility-specific pricing
- **20 Medications** with strength/dosage form
- **30 Inventory Items** (medications + consumables) × 3 facilities with batches
- **4 Suppliers**
- **3 Sample Patients** with insurance, allergies, and medical history

The seed script is **idempotent** — it can be re-run safely without creating duplicates.

---

## 🗄️ Database Architecture

The Prisma schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`) defines **90+ tables** organized into 16 functional domains:

1. **Organization hierarchy**: organizations → facilities → departments → units; wards → rooms → beds
2. **Identity & access**: users, staff, staff_facilities, roles, permissions, role_permissions, user_roles
3. **Patient master index**: patients, patient_identifiers, patient_contacts, emergency_contacts, next_of_kin, insurance_providers, patient_insurance
4. **Encounters**: encounters, appointments, queues, queue_entries, triage_records, vital_signs
5. **Clinical**: consultations, diagnoses, allergies, medical_history, surgical_history, family_history, social_history
6. **Medications**: medications, prescriptions, prescription_items, medication_administration
7. **Laboratory**: laboratory_tests, lab_orders, lab_order_items, lab_samples, lab_results (with amendments)
8. **Imaging & procedures**: imaging_orders, imaging_reports, procedures
9. **Inpatient**: admissions, bed_assignments, patient_transfers, discharge_records, nursing_notes, care_plans
10. **Maternity**: maternity_records, newborn_records
11. **Billing**: services, facility_service_prices, invoices, invoice_items, payments, refunds, insurance_claims
12. **Inventory**: inventory_items, facility_inventory, inventory_batches, inventory_transactions, suppliers, purchase_orders, goods_received, stock_transfers
13. **Equipment**: equipment, equipment_maintenance
14. **HR**: staff_shifts, leave_records
15. **Operations**: documents, consents, tasks, notifications
16. **Compliance**: audit_logs, patient_access_logs, break_glass_events, system_settings, patient_merge_events

### Porting to Neon PostgreSQL

The schema is portable to Neon PostgreSQL. To switch:

1. Change the `datasource` in `prisma/schema.prisma`:
   ```prisma
   datasource db {
     provider = "postgresql"
     url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
   }
   ```
2. Set `DATABASE_URL` to your Neon connection string in `.env`
3. Run `bun run db:push` to create the schema on Neon

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### ONE PATIENT = ONE MASTER RECORD
Patients are organization-level (NOT facility-owned). Encounters are facility-specific and reference the same `patient_id`. A patient registered at Facility A can visit Facility B without creating a duplicate.

### Multi-facility Support
- Users can switch facility in the topbar
- Data is scoped server-side via `facilityId` query parameter
- Staff can be assigned to multiple facilities via `staff_facilities` table
- Roles can be scoped to a specific facility via `user_roles.facilityId`

### Transactional Integrity
Critical operations are atomic via `db.$transaction`:
- **Admission**: create admission + assign bed (set bed.status='occupied') + create BedAssignment
- **Discharge**: create discharge record + set admission.status='discharged' + release bed + close encounter
- **Pharmacy dispense**: decrement batch + decrement inventory + update prescription item + create InventoryTransaction + auto-bill invoice
- **Payment**: create payment + update invoice balance + change invoice status (paid/partially_paid)
- **Stock transfer**: decrement source inventory + increment destination inventory + create transfer_out/transfer_in transactions
- **Goods received**: create batch + increment inventory + create receive transaction

### Bed Double-Booking Prevention
Bed assignments use DB transactions with row-level checks — two nurses cannot assign the same bed simultaneously.

### Inventory Integrity
Every `currentQuantity` change creates an `InventoryTransaction` record. Inventory is never silently overwritten — the full transaction ledger preserves the audit trail.

### Lab Result Amendments
Verified lab results cannot be overwritten. Amendments create a new `LabResult` row with `amendedFromId` pointing to the original, preserving the full chain.

### Audit Logging
Every sensitive operation writes an `AuditLog` entry:
- `PATIENT_CREATED`, `PATIENT_VIEWED`, `PATIENT_UPDATED`, `PATIENT_MERGED`
- `LAB_RESULT_VERIFIED`, `LAB_RESULT_AMENDED`
- `INVOICE_CREATED`, `PAYMENT_RECEIVED`, `REFUND_PROCESSED`
- `BED_ASSIGNED`, `PATIENT_TRANSFERRED`, `PATIENT_DISCHARGED`
- `USER_CREATED`, `ROLE_CHANGED`, `PERMISSION_CHANGED`
- `BREAK_GLASS_USED`, `DATA_EXPORTED`

Plus separate `PatientAccessLog` entries for every patient record view.

## 🔐 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# Database (SQLite for development, PostgreSQL/Neon for production)
DATABASE_URL="file:./db/custom.db"
# For Neon PostgreSQL:
# DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host/dbname?sslmode=require"

# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-super-secret-string-here"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

> ⚠️ **Never commit `.env` to git**. The `.gitignore` already excludes it.

---

## 🧪 Testing the Workflows

### End-to-End Clinical Workflow
1. Log in as `receptionist` → register a new patient (try registering twice to see duplicate detection)
2. Log in as `doctor` → create an encounter for the patient → record triage → write consultation → order lab test → prescribe medication
3. Log in as `labscientist` → collect sample → enter result → verify → release
4. Log in as `pharmacist` → approve prescription → dispense (with batch selection)
5. Log in as `cashier` → create invoice → record payment
6. Log in as `superadmin` → check audit logs to see every action recorded

### Multi-facility Test
1. Log in as `superadmin`
2. Use the facility switcher in the topbar to switch between Accra/Kasoa/Tema
3. Verify that data (encounters, inventory, beds) is scoped per facility
4. Register a patient at Facility A → switch to Facility B → search the same patient → create encounter at Facility B (no duplicate patient created)

---

## 📊 Default Roles & Permissions

The system ships with 13 default roles and 92 granular permissions:

- **super_admin** — full access to everything
- **organization_admin** — org-wide management (no super_admin powers)
- **facility_admin** — facility-scoped management
- **doctor** — clinical workflows (consult, prescribe, admit, sign notes)
- **nurse** — triage, vitals, nursing notes, bed management
- **pharmacist** — dispense, inventory, procurement
- **laboratory_scientist** — lab orders, results, verification, amendment
- **radiographer** — imaging orders, reports, verification
- **receptionist** — patient registration, appointments, encounters
- **cashier** — billing, payments
- **accountant** — full finance, refunds, insurance claims, reports
- **records_officer** — patient merge, document management, exports
- **inventory_officer** — inventory, procurement, stock transfers

Custom roles can be created via Admin → Roles.

## 🛡️ Security Notes

- Passwords are bcrypt-hashed (never stored in plain text)
- Account lockout after 5 failed login attempts (15-minute lockout)
- Session timeout: 8 hours
- All sensitive API endpoints require authentication + permission check
- Audit logs are append-only (no PATCH/DELETE endpoints)
- Patient access is logged separately for HIPAA-style compliance
- The schema is designed for Row-Level Security (RLS) on PostgreSQL

### Production Hardening Checklist
- [ ] Change all default user passwords
- [ ] Set a strong `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` (use `openssl rand -base64 32`)
- [ ] Switch to PostgreSQL/Neon for production
- [ ] Enable HTTPS (use Vercel, Cloudflare, or a reverse proxy)
- [ ] Configure backup strategy for the database
- [ ] Review and customize role permissions per hospital policy
- [ ] Set up monitoring (Sentry, Datadog, or similar)
- [ ] Conduct security review with hospital compliance team
- [ ] Validate against Ghanaian Data Protection Act requirements
