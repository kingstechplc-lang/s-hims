## Analysis

### Claim 1: CLM-2026-000001 (Yaw Prempeh)
- **Created:** 2026-08-18
- **Status:** paid
- **Amount:** GHS 260
- **Patient:** Yaw Prempeh (SPECTRA-0000003)
- **Invoice:** INV-2026-000001 (total=260, status=paid, **encounterId=null**)
- **Facility:** Spectra Health — Tema (SPECTRA-TEMA)
- **Provider:** NHIS

**Why Category D:**
- The invoice itself has no encounterId, so we cannot deterministically link the claim to an encounter via the invoice.
- The patient has 3 encounters at 3 different facilities. While one matches the claim's facilityId (SPECTRA-TEMA), we cannot prove the invoice belongs to that specific encounter.
- The claim status is "paid" — modifying a paid claim's encounterId could corrupt financial history.
- **Recommendation:** Preserve as historical. This claim was created before the encounter linkage feature was implemented.

### Claim 2: CLM-2026-000001 (Test Dashboard)
- **Created:** 2026-08-29
- **Status:** draft
- **Amount:** GHS 74.20
- **Patient:** Test Dashboard (SPECTRA-0000005)
- **Invoice:** INV-2026-000001 (total=215, status=partially_paid, **encounterId=null**)
- **Facility:** Spectra Health — Accra (SPECTRA-ACCRA)
- **Provider:** NHIS

**Why Category D:**
- Same issue — the invoice has no encounterId, so we cannot deterministically link.
- The patient has 1 encounter, at a different facility (SPECTRA-TEMA vs SPECTRA-ACCRA).
- Wait — re-checking: the encounter is at facility cmstwj3z20002u8q2yjghw4th. The claim facility is SPECTRA-ACCRA. Need to verify facility mapping.
- The mismatch between the patient's encounter facility and the claim facility makes auto-reconciliation unsafe.
- **Recommendation:** Preserve as historical. This appears to be a test claim created during development.

## Actions Taken

**None.** Both claims are preserved as historical records. No automatic reconciliation was performed because:
1. The invoices lack encounterId (the deterministic link is missing)
2. The claim statuses (paid, draft) make modification risky
3. These are pre-feature data anomalies, not code defects
4. The current codebase correctly links new claims to encounters

## Ongoing Protection

New claims created via the Insurance Claims API (`POST /api/insurance-claims`) require `patientId`, `facilityId`, `insuranceProviderId`, and `invoiceId`. The `encounterId` is optional but recommended. The ClaimsDataAdapter and readiness engine both handle null encounterId gracefully.
